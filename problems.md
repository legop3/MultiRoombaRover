## video stream
- video stream needs to always autoplay, even if it cant unmute itself
  - currently, it wont play at all unless it can unmute
- video stream currently unloads and reloads based on the tab being active
  - just remove this feature. It needs to stay running all the time.

## UI and session info
- UI needs a display for the turns mode

## UI tweaks and fixes
- remove redundant rover name tags everywhere
  - just have one in the hud: "You are driving <name>"
- unify colors and roundeds
  - no borders, ever
  - no ALL CAPS FONTS ever
  - nothing should be rounded at all.
  - webpage background color: black
  - panels should all be the same lighter gray
    - things inside panels should be a darker gray
      - buttons should be even darker, almost black
      - all buttons should have a hover effect which lightens them a little
