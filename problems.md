## video stream
- video stream needs to always autoplay, even if it cant unmute itself
  - currently, it wont play at all unless it can unmute
- video stream currently unloads and reloads based on the tab being active
  - just remove this feature. It needs to stay running all the time.

## server sensor decoding
- OI mode is not decoded properly
  - says "safe" when in passive, and "unknown" when in full.

## react UI and auth
- after logging in as an admin and selecting a rover, the UI is still greyed out anc blocked. No video shows
