# Multi Roomba Rover

a remake of my RoombaRover project with a decentralized and embedded approach
supports multiple roombas

on each roomba:
- a raspberry pi zero 2 w
  - a raspberry pi camera
- roomba's serial port hooked up to the built in serial port on the raspberry pi

pi provisioning:
- enable serial port
- disable wifi powersave
- disable bluetooth
