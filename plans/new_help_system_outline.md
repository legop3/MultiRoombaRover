# general idea
- a help system that pops up onscreen
- changes based on control layout
  - mobile / desktop
- on desktop especially, keybinds will dynamically update, based on what is actually assigned

# UI layout specifics:
- remake the current help component from scratch
  - leave it in the place where it is, so people can always look at the help
- match the styling of the rest of the page
- make sure the help is easy to edit
- add a pop-up which displays underneath any other popup layers, which will display the help component in a large format
  - make this pop-up show every time UNLESS the user checks "dont show again"
    - use the settings system to store this in the browser

# what will the help explain?
- how to use the nickname and chat
- how to start driving the rover
- rover controls
  - this is the biggest thing that will change in different layouts
- how it works technically (just a placeholder for now)
