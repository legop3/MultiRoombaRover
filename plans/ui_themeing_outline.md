# general idea
- users can choose from preset, and create UI themes
- the default theme is the current in place theme
- themes will NOT change margins, borders, padding, spacing, etc. 
- should be as simple as changing the global css stuff
- themes can change colors, fonts, border radius, borders, etc

## technical stuff
- save theme info in 

## UI for themeing
- allow people to tune every theme element that there is to tune
- allow people to export themes as json files, and import them
