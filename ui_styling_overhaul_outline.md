# general idea:
- very compact UI
- utilitarian
  - function before pretty
  - tiny text, too.
- no large margins or padding. very little wasted space
  - up to 1 tailwind unit unless otherwise needed
- black background, gray cards, white or gray text
- tailwind
- no title or bar at the top, vertical screen space is precious on all layouts
- alerts should be moved to a tiny toast popup that will show at the top center of the screen

# three different layouts for the driver page
- desktop
  - rover video central, no title or anything above it
  - overlayed on rover video (HUD like in a video game)
    - build the HUD into the video tile
      - because everywhere the video is, the HUD should be too
    - shows a dot that blinks on each sensor frame
    - shows wheel drops and bumpers
    - shows a big "loud" warning overlay during an overcurrent
    - simple, easy to understand battery bar UNDERNEATH the video:
      - takes in battery full, warn, and urgent values
      - treat full as 100% and warn as 0%
      - make the bar flash red when its 0% or lower
  - on left side of rover video:
    - sensor data, visualized.
      - battery charge out of capacity (1763/2068)
      - charging status
      - OI mode
      - battery voltage (in volts not mv)
      - battery current
      - a teeny show of the raw data (because we get it on the client and it looks cool)
  - on right side of rover video
    - a simple, easy control panel with the following actions:
      - a button that runs the start OI, dock, then full commands (in that order)
        - also contains a little status of whether or not the rover is in "driving mode" (OI in full mode)
      - a button that tells the rover to seek dock
        - explains that you should be straight in front of, and about a foot from the dock for a successful attempt
        - contains two status indicators:
          - docked / not docked (homebase true)
          - charging / not charging (when chargingstate isn't "not charging" the rover is charging)
  - below the upper control and video row
    - center:
      - a place for the room camera (not implemented yet)
    - left:
      - admin login and controls
    - right:
      - logs
- mobile in portrait mode
  - rover video at the top, with HUD
  - just below:
    - joystick with buttons for aux. motor controls
      - have a button to run all aux motors forward at max speed
      - also have buttons to run motors forward / backward individually
      - probably use some premade react joystick
  - scroll down more to see:
    - the same simple mode control buttons from the desktop layout
    - also needs to have the admin login and controls
    - needs to have all the functionality as the desktop page
- mobile in landscape mode
  - made for videogame-like control of the rover
  - control buttons and aux motors on the left
  - rover video in the middle
  - joystick on the right
  - again, scroll down to see more
  - also has to do everything
